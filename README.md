# 🧠 AMLE-GCN: Attentional Multilayer Ensemble Graph Convolutional Network

Welcome to the official implementation of **AMLE-GCN**, a cutting-edge framework designed for **skeleton-based rehabilitation exercise assessment**. This repository supports the paper:  
📄 *"Attentional Multilayer Ensemble Graph Neural Networks for Skeleton-based Exercise Assessment."*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**AMLE-GCN** addresses key challenges in home-based rehabilitation, such as:
- Difficulty in prioritizing critical joints.
- Poor modeling of long-range dependencies in body movements.
- High sensitivity to noisy skeletal data.

Using **multi-head attention mechanisms** and a **multi-level ensemble strategy**, AMLE-GCN provides precise, adaptive, and robust assessments of rehabilitation exercises.

## 🔍 Key Features
- ✅ **Dynamic Attention Mechanism:** Focuses on critical joints and temporal dependencies.
- 📊 **Multi-Level Ensemble Learning:** Enhances performance through feature-level, decision-level, and model-level ensembles.
- 🌐 **Dual Data Streams:** Integrates positional and orientation data for comprehensive assessments.
- 🧠 **Robust to Noise:** Performs well even with noisy skeletal data from sensors like Kinect.

## 📈 Results
Achieved **state-of-the-art performance** on benchmark datasets:
- **UI-PRMD Dataset:** 89.6% accuracy  
- **KIMORE Dataset:** 86.2% accuracy  

These results significantly outperform existing methods in skeleton-based exercise assessment.
